This study explores the complex electromechanical dynamics of the heart during stress testing, with particular focus on cardiac event hysteresis phenomena. The work investigates how electrical and mechanical cardiac events interact and influence each other during different stress conditions, providing new insights into cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.

The research utilizes advanced signal processing techniques to analyze simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings during stress tests. The findings reveal important patterns in cardiac event timing and their hysteresis behavior, which could have significant implications for cardiac health assessment and risk stratification. This work represents a collaborative effort between multiple institutions and demonstrates the application of sophisticated signal processing methods to cardiovascular health research.
