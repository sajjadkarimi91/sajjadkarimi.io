## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at **Emory University School of Medicine**, specializing in biomedical signal processing, machine learning, and statistical modeling. My research focuses on advancing health diagnostics through the analysis and modeling of complex multi-channel biomedical signals, including brain and heart data.

My expertise spans **statistical signal processing**, **machine learning**, and **advanced modeling techniques** to extract biomarkers that improve cardiovascular and neurophysiological health assessments. I am passionate about mentoring students, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, and publishing research that drives innovation in biomedical signal processing.

## Research Interests

My experience includes processing & modeling biomedical signals & financial time series using the following areas:

- **Statistical Signal Processing**
- **Machine Learning** 
- **Coupled Hidden Markov Models**
- **Statistical Inference & Modeling**
- **Mathematical Optimization**
- **Biomedical Signal Analysis**
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces**
- **Cardiovascular Signal Processing**

## Current Research

### Doctoral Research: "A New Coupled HMM Framework & Applications in Multi-channel Brain Signal Processing"

My research focuses on the **Latent Structure Influence Model (LSIM)**, a type of Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM). Our contributions are divided into theory and application parts:

**Theory**: We proposed a new fast approximate inference algorithm for LSIMs, proved the convergence of the proposed learning framework, and developed an EM algorithm for parameter re-estimation.

**Applications**: We proposed two new applications using LSIMs including channel fusion for improving sleep staging performance and a new estimator for brain connectivity. We found that LSIM had better performance than HMMs and CHMMs.

## Professional Experience

### Current Position
**Postdoctoral Fellow** | *Emory University School of Medicine* | *October 2024 - Present*

As a Postdoctoral Fellow in Biomedical Informatics, I contribute to advancing health diagnostics by analyzing and modeling complex multi-channel biomedical signals. My work leverages statistical signal processing, machine learning, and advanced modeling techniques to extract biomarkers that improve cardiovascular and neurophysiological health assessments.

### Previous Experience
**Senior Data Scientist & Quantitative Analyst** | *Charisma Financial Information Processing* | *April 2022 - September 2024*

Developed and implemented an AI-driven portfolio management system using MLOps, machine learning models, MDP, and Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Applied statistical models to predict and analyze the options market, achieving a 10% excess return on a $30,000 test fund in four months. Optimized portfolios using the Black-Litterman model, successfully managing a $2.5 million fund with a $23 million turnover over two years.
